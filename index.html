        Loneliness can be a challenging experience, particularly for girls who
        feel isolated and disconnected from others. It is possible to feel happy
        even during periods of loneliness. In this blog post, I will share my
        personal experiences that have helped me find happiness and fulfillment
        when I was isolated from others.

    <center><h2>Lonliness</h2></center>
    <br />
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">
      Growing up as an only child, I had the opportunity to develop
      independence. While some may assume that being an only child leads to
      loneliness, I was fortunate to have constant support and companionship
      from my loving family members. Despite occasional moments of solitude, I
      never felt solitude because I discovered the power of self-entertainment.
      Engaging in activities and games brought me immense joy and kept me
      happily occupied. During my school years, I was fortunate to always have
      the company of my family and friends. Loneliness was not a familiar
      feeling to me during that time. I cherished the moments spent with loved
      ones. Although I had a cousin, our age difference meant that we didn't
      always play together. While we enjoyed occasional playtime, he found
      greater happiness when surrounded by peers of his own age, I cherished the
      moments we spent together. However, a few years ago, he tragically passed
      away, leaving me deeply saddened by his absence. In the midst of grief, I
      found solace in believing that he was still with me in spirit, even though
      he had disappeared physically. With his memory as a guiding light, I found
      the strength to carry on and make my family proud of the person I was
      becoming.

      <br />
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">
        When the time came for me to pursue my higher studies, I found myself in
        a situation where I had to leave my family and friends. This transition
        was not easy, and I initially felt a sense of loneliness and longing for
        a companion. But, I soon realized that this is a period of opportunity
        for my personal growth and self-discovery. I started to explore my area
        of interest. When I learn something in my area of interest that was a
        special feeling not explained by words.

      <p style="font-size: 25px;">
        When I was alone, I realise the beauty of self-love and self-care. I
        started appreciating my work I realized that by acknowledging and
        appreciating my work, I was motivated to strive for greater things in
        the upcoming days. The love and appreciation I extended to myself
        brought happiness that made me feel like the happiest person in the
        world.
